#### Description:
Full-Stack Web Application project developed to help football news reporter the ability to register to enable them to write and post their football news articles which can be stored in the database and dynamically generate to the web page for view and read.

This is a project I am proud of because before I started my Software Engineering studies I always dreamt of building a project of this kind. 

The project challenges and helps me to learn and broaden my knowledge in Python, Django and it's models, Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Relational Database for the Back-End, and HTML, Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap (CSS and Javascript) for the Front-End.

For softwares to run please check **requirements.txt**.
